Solutions to exercises summarizing the chapters from the Next.py course

## Description ##
This is a direct continuation of the repository I prepared for the preliminary course, Self.py, it is recommended to read its README before reading this README - see your warning!

That summer of 2021, I decided on my own to do Self.py's continuation course, Next.py, so that I could deepen my knowledge of the Python language before the beginning of the school year in my major.
The course itself is divided into 6 chapters that contain a concluding exercise. As in the previous course I did, I also did and kept the exercises I was asked to do during the course, which will turn out to be the right decision today.

As with Self.py, I was asked by the same institution to do the Next.py course and to upload to GitHub my solutions for the concluding exercises of the course. Luckily I already had them due to the wise decision I made in the past. What is attached to you here are the same exercises I wrote at the beginning of my studies as a programmer after I improved them a little, added comments to them, divided them into files and folders, and added code (in the main.py file) which gives the user the option to easily choose which chapter summary exercise he wants to run.
